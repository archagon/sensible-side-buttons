# Sensible Side Buttons

OS X mostly ignores the M4/M5 mouse buttons, commonly used for navigation.
Third-party apps can bind them to ⌘+[ and ⌘+], but this only works in a small
number of apps and feels janky. With this tool, your side buttons will simulate
3-finger swipes, allowing you to navigate almost any window with a history. As
seen in the Logitech MX Master!
